"""HyperVault MCP server (PRD 2).

Lets any MCP-capable agent save artifacts straight into a user's HyperVault
and claim vanity subdomains, by calling the same backend the web app uses.

Configuration (environment variables):
    HYPERVAULT_API_KEY   required — created in the web dashboard (/vault)
    HYPERVAULT_API_URL   optional — defaults to https://hypervault.store

Run over STDIO (local agents):
    hypervault-mcp

Run over HTTP (web agents):
    hypervault-mcp --transport http --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8787

    HTTP mode requires HYPERVAULT_API_KEY to be set — the same key doubles
    as the bearer token callers must present (Authorization: Bearer <key>)
    to reach any tool. Without it, anyone who can reach the port would get
    full access to the operator's vault (delete_vault_item, write_artifact,
    forget_memory, ...), so the server refuses to start in HTTP mode
    without it. STDIO mode is unaffected (FastMCP never applies auth checks
    to stdio, matching its single-local-process trust model).

    permanently to the user's HyperVault and get back a shareable URL.

    React/JSX content is detected automatically and wrapped into a working
    standalone page — you can pass a bare component and it will just work.

    Args:
        content: The full HTML document or React/JSX source to save.
        title: Human-friendly title shown in the user's vault.
        type: Content hint: "html", "jsx", "report", "game", etc.

        connect_to: Titles or slugs of related artifacts. Creates
            bidirectional connections drawn as edges in the vault's graph view.
        make_pwa: When true (default), the page gets a manifest and
            Add-to-Home-Screen support so it installs like a native app.
        source_prompt: The prompt that produced this artifact (max 10,000

            <meta name="hypervault-source-prompt"> tag, so any agent that

        visibility: "private" (default) or "public". Private artifacts only
            open for the signed-in owner and accounts they invite from the
            vault dashboard; public ones open for anyone with the link.
        mutable: When true, save a *living document* you can rewrite later.

    Saving the exact same content twice is safe: HyperVault detects the
    duplicate and returns the existing artifact's URL (with `duplicate: true`)

    never a duplicate, so each mutable save creates its own artifact.)
